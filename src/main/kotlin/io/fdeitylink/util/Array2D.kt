/**
 * A class that simplifies implementing a rectangular two-dimensional array so as
 * to avoid confusing code that uses `Array<Array<T>>`.
 *
 * An `Array2D` should be considered as a series of _rows of elements_ rather than a
 * series of columns of elements, which matters for iterating over it, methods like
 * `get(y: Int)` and the primary constructor's parameters. Given the following 2D array
 *
 * ```
 * //Java
 * int[][] arr = {{0,  1,  2},
 *                {3,  4,  5},
 *                {6,  7,  8},
 *                {9, 10, 11}};
 * ```
 *
 * the height would be considered `4` and width `3`, and any iterating would pass through
 * 0, 1, and 2 before 3, 4, and 5, and so on.
 *
 * @param T the type of the element to be stored by this `Array2D`
 *
 * @constructor
 * Constructs a new `Array2D`, given its [width], [height], and a [backing] 2D array.
 * This constructor is useful for turning a regular Java 2D array (or `Array<Array<T>>`)
 * into an `Array2D`. For example, the following would create an `Array2D` with `regArray`
 * as its backing list.
 *
 * ```
 * //Java
 * String[][] regArray = {{"Hello", "World"}, {"Alice", "Bob"}};
 * Array2D<String> array2D = new Array2D<String>(regArray[0].length, regArray.length, regArray);
 * ```
 *
 * Most of the time, however, the [emptyArray2D], [array2DOfNulls], and [invoke] methods should
 * be used for constructing a new `Array2D`.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [height] does not match [backing.size][Array.size],
 * [width] does not match the width of at least one row of [backing], or [backing] is not
 * a purely rectangular array (the widths of its rows are inconsistent).
 *
 * @property width The width of this `Array2D`.
 *
 * @property height The height of this `Array2D`.
 *
 * @property backing The backing `Array<Array<T>>` of this `Array2D`. It can be used for
 * methods that expect a standard Java 2D array (or Kotlin methods not using this class).
 * For example, the following would give `methodTakingStandard2DArray` direct access to
 * the contents of this `Array2D` (thereby also allowing it to modify elements).
 * ```
 * //Kotlin
 * methodTakingStandard2DArray(anArray2D.backing)
 * ```
